Hold machinery removed
----------------------

Setting or unsetting ``hold`` (deprecated in version 2.1) has now
been completely removed. Matplotlib now always behaves as if ``hold=True``.
To clear an axes you can manually use :meth:`~.axes.Axes.cla()`,
or to clear an entire figure use :meth:`~.figure.Figure.clf()`.
