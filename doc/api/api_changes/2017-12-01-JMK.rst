The ticks for colorbar now adjust for the size of the colorbar
--------------------------------------------------------------

Colorbar ticks now adjust for the size of the colorbar if the
colorbar is made from a mappable that is not a contour or
doesn't have a BoundaryNorm, or boundaries are not specified.
If boundaries, etc are specified, the colorbar maintains the
original behaviour.
